# Account-based Trading Platform using C++ (Oct. - Nov. 2022)

• Built a marketplace that allows dorm students to list and purchase second-hand products in a coherent command-line interface. 

• Login and registration system secures user listings behind a password protected data-wall. 

• Accommodates for the inputs of multiple users and saves market trade history as account metadata for future sessions.

• Utilized a combination of vectors and file-I/O-stream to retain information between logins and differentiate seller and buyer activity.

• Tracks the movement of products through the market using a randomized 4-letter identifier that is assigned to every product at its conception.
